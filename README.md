# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms Playground

This repo is my personal **DS & Algorithms playground** 🧠✨  
I use it whenever I’m **learning a new programming language** or practicing **core data structures and algorithms**.

Instead of just reading theory, I implement the same ideas across different languages to understand:
- how the language works
- how performance and syntax differ
- how fundamentals stay the same everywhere

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- 📦 Core **Data Structures** (Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)
- 🔁 Classic **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Traversals)
- 🌍 Multi-language implementations for comparison and learning

## 🗂️ Languages I'm Practicing With

- [x] C  
- [x] C++  
- [x] Python  
- [ ] Go  ⏳
- [ ] Java  
- [ ] Rust  
- [ ] JavaScript / TypeScript  

_(I check these off as I actively practice DS & algorithms in each language.)_

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

- To build strong fundamentals
- To learn new languages by writing real code
- To revisit DS & algorithms without overengineering

Think of it as my **coding notebook**, but public 😄

## 🛠️ Contributions

If you’re also learning or practicing, feel free to explore, fork, or add your own implementations!

Happy coding 🚀
